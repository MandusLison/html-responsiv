        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Right now I am studying at NTI Gymnasiet in Nacka Strand, where I am
          studying IT, Programming and Media Technology. I have always worked
          since a young age alongside my studies and I want to continue doing
          that. My experience with work is that you gain more experience of
          course, but also become more independent. During my entire upbringing,
          I have been brought up with the mindset "that it is required". very
          little, to be able to perform better than the average". To go all the
          way and going the extra mile is a matter of course for me and part of
          my personality. I always give my all, in what I do. I think I fit best
          in a central role, as do:er. Is there anything I can't do? so I always
          want to learn more and am curious about most things. In my role at the
          café where I work part-time now, I have taken on extra
          responsibilities, managed staff, took care of purchases and planned
          events etc. I am used to reporting to managers, owners and other
          stakeholders, as well as having overall responsibility. In my role as
          a salesperson (had two jobs at the same time) I have successfully sold
          goods in "the hardest selling industry there is", i.e. door salesman.
          Tough but useful. That's why you should meet me: Organized and
          Structured - Order and order are A and O for me. I am ambitious and
          flexible. Likes to organize and plan. Enjoy working at a fast pace
          with varied tasks. Self-motivated and easy to learn - I am very easy
          to learn, ambitious and despite my age I am probably already a bit of
          a "people person" who can both work hard and sell products in the best
          way. Unprestigious - I take nothing for granted and I would describe
          myself as a humble, unprestigious and positive person. No job is too
          small, too big, too dirty or too nice. I have a high work ethic when
          it comes to completing the assignments I am given and a "Yes" is
          obvious instead of "soon". If you want a real do:er and people person,
          choose me. You will not be disappointed!

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>
              This was the first project we did. We would download Live Server
              in Visual Studio Code, Create a website with: text & image,
              Validate the page with W3C Validator, Create different links,
              Full, absolute, relative and links within a page and link for
              email and Change style with CSS and try to make your page look
              better.

            <img src="project3.jpg" alt="Project 2" />
            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>
              In this project I learned some basics in Javascript, Decide on a
              function, Created the project under new folder, Sketched up an
              interface in Figma or with HTML/CSS, Used grid/flex in CSS in my
              design and Validate to know if all works as it should.
